# Weesong
A web anisong player app. 
Frontend-only, I'll maybe work on a proper backend once I learn how to use node properly.

Paths and filenames for mp3s & images** are specified on the db files so if you happen to have the files (LEGALLY, OF COURSE) you can give it a try, or use the same format for including your own songs.

Build with:


    npm install
    gulp quick


**Assets not included because of size and legal stuff.
